This folder contains scripts for running a DNN on your MFCCs or Filterbanks

files:

-dnn_data; scripts to load your dataset into train, val and test sets. 

-dnn; conv net implementation

-dnn_filt; conv net with in-built and trainable filterbank conversion

-filters.npy; triangular filter coefficients for dnn_filt;

-filters2.npy; same as filters.npy but without 0 values for the coefficients.

-split.npy; file detailing for each wav file whether it belongs to train test or val.

Acknowledgements:

dnn files were started from a Lasagne example file.
